Like my previous encoding project but actually likely finishedable. Also in C++.  

Now with encoding and decoding options.  

Saving codes has arrived. Create code legends, store, and even reopen previous codes.

Cool right.  
I know right.  
Super cool.

JSON functionality uses [nholmann/json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json)  

Unfortunately Windows is not currently supported, the program has only been tested inside Clion with Linux. Compatibility *may* be added.  
This is currently being worked on in the filesystemUpgrade branch.   
Main branch should work on Windows if run in CLion.  
Progress is being made on functionality anywhere, also on multi-platform builds.
